# Godogen — From Prompt to Playable Game

Godogen is an autonomous development pipeline for turning a natural-language game brief into a playable Godot, Bevy, or Babylon.js project. It plans the game, generates visual direction and assets, writes code, and captures media from the running engine for visual review.

It is not a game engine, a code generator, or an asset marketplace. It is a source repo for runtime skills that are published into a fresh game repo and then executed by Claude Code or Codex.

## Source Model

The repo is organized by engine:

- `shared/` — engine-agnostic `godogen` stages, the shared `Stop` hook, and common published-repo instructions
- `godot/` — Godot-specific `godogen` stages and `godot-api`
- `bevy/` — Bevy-specific `godogen` stages and `bevy-help`
- `babylon/` — Babylon.js-specific `godogen` stages, Vite scaffold, browser capture, and `babylon-help`

Claude Code vs Codex is selected at render time:

```bash
./publish.sh --engine godot --agent claude --out ~/game
./publish.sh --engine godot --agent codex --out ~/game
./publish.sh --engine bevy --agent claude --out ~/game
./publish.sh --engine bevy --agent codex --out ~/game
./publish.sh --engine babylon --agent claude --out ~/game
./publish.sh --engine babylon --agent codex --out ~/game
```

Publishing writes `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, or `AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/skills/` for Codex. Codex `agents/openai.yaml` files are generated from each rendered `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

## Pipeline

The `godogen` skill orchestrates the run and loads stage-specific files only when they are needed:

1. **Visual target** — generate `reference.png` and write art direction into `ASSETS.md`.
2. **Decomposition** — write `PLAN.md`, isolating only genuinely risky features.
3. **Scaffold** — create or update the engine project shell and `STRUCTURE.md`.
4. **Asset planning and generation** — spend the user-provided budget on the assets that matter most.
5. **Task execution** — implement risk slices first, then the main build.
6. **Capture** — create a fresh `screenshots/result/{N}/` bundle with raw `frameXXX.png` files and `video.mp4`.
7. **Telegram push** — the shared stop hook pushes the latest proof video to Telegram when `tg-push` and `TG_*` env vars are configured; otherwise it no-ops.

The document protocol is deliberate. `PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `ASSETS.md`, and `MEMORY.md` survive context compaction and let the run resume from files instead of conversational memory.

## Engine Support

Godot output is a Godot 4 C#/.NET project. The Godot runtime skill uses scene builders for generated `.tscn` files, runtime scripts for gameplay, `godot-api` for targeted engine lookup, and a Godot capture helper for final proof bundles.

Bevy output is a Rust/Bevy project. The Bevy runtime skill uses code-first scene construction, local Bevy rustdoc/examples through `bevy-help`, and a dedicated capture path for final proof bundles.

Babylon.js output is a TypeScript/Vite browser project. The Babylon runtime skill uses a disposable Vite scaffold, scene-level hot reload, local npm package lookup through `babylon-help`, and Chrome/Chromium browser capture.

Godot and Bevy final proof bundles include `video.mp4` plus raw frames. Babylon final proof bundles record browser video directly and include `video.webm` plus encoded `video.mp4`.

## What Makes This Different

**Capture-first proof.** The pipeline captures actual frames from the game and assembles them into a final proof bundle, so the run is judged on what the game looks like rather than on what the code claims.

**Progressive loading.** The orchestrator reads only the stage file it needs at the moment. Support skills keep large engine references out of the main context.

**Budget-aware asset generation.** Gemini, Grok, and Tripo3D are used where they make economic sense, and generated assets are assigned back into `PLAN.md` so implementation does not lose them.

**Engine-specific expertise without agent duplication.** Godot, Bevy, and Babylon.js are different enough to keep their engine docs separate. Claude and Codex are similar enough to render from one source.

## Runtime Limitations

The current runtime does not ship a dedicated audio pipeline. Godot supports debug APK export when requested; Bevy and Babylon mobile/native packaging are not implemented yet.
